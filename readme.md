# Advenet of Code 2024

Advent of code is an online coding challenge, existing since 2018. The rules to participate are simple:
1. One coding puzzle will be available very morning.
2. When you solve this code puzzle then you get a hint to solve the next puzzle of the day.
3. You only need to submit the final answer of the puzzle into the advent of code website.
4. Upon correct answer you get a star for each puzzle you solve. In a day you could earn two stars.

## Aim of this repository 
Aim of this repository is to house all the efforts that I will make to solve the advent of code puzzle. This is my first time in competitive programming hence want to preserve the effort and if needed discuss fellow puzzle solvers like Olaf G. who introduced me to advent of code.

## Conclusion
Feel free to share your feedback via review or by opening an issue.

Happy coding!รถ
